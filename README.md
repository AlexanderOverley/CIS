# CIS
Sample programs I made for assignments in Computer Information Systems at University of Louisville College of Business

Assignments 9,10,and 11 are the final project from CIS 310, a course in data bases using Microsoft SQL Server.
Assignment 9 focused on creating views for sales data. 
Assignment 10 focused on listing the employees and their total merchandise 
sales expressed as a percentage of total merchandise sales for all employees.
Assignment 11 focused on listing merchandise sales data based on months. 

Module 9 contains HTML, Javascript, and CSS code from CIS 150 focusing on web development. The featured samples show an animated countdown display, a display of the current date, and a formatted and designed webpage assignment. 

CIS 199 contains work from that course which taught basic C#. The programs feature use of arrays, modification of arrays, arrays in paralell, basic graphic user interface design, and progam features like functions, algorithms, and classes.
